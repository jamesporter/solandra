# Getting Started

## Jump into code

Solandra Codesandbox (uses React, though other frameworks would be very similar): [Solandra CodeSandbox v0.18](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/solandra-0-18-react-example-ll5gjg).

To start coding: clone [this project](https://github.com/jamesporter/solandra) to
try out as add React/NextJS powered GUI around stuff.

On [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/solandra). Install with `npm i solandra` or `yarn add solandra`.

There is a React wrapper for those using the most popular front end framework, install from [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/solandra-react) with `npm i solandra-react solandra react react-dom`.
